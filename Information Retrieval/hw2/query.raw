operating system for IBM computers?

 I am interested in articles written either by Prieve or Udo Pooch

 Intermediate languages used in construction of multi-targeted compilers; TCOLL

 I'm interested in mechanisms for communicating between disjoint processes,
possibly, but not exclusively, in a distributed environment.  I would
rather see descriptions of complete mechanisms, with or without implementations,
as opposed to theoretical work on the abstract problem.  Remote procedure
calls and message-passing are examples of my interests.


.I 5
.W
 I'd like papers on design and implementation of editing interfaces,
window-managers, command interpreters, etc.  The essential issues are
human interface design, with views on improvements to user efficiency,
effectiveness and satisfaction.


.I 6
.W
 Interested in articles on robotics, motion planning particularly the
geometric and combinatorial aspects.  We are not interested in the
dynamics of arm motion.


.I 7
.W
 I am interested in distributed algorithms - concurrent programs in
which processes communicate and synchronize by using message passing.
Areas of particular interest include fault-tolerance and techniques
for understanding the correctness of these algorithms.

 Addressing schemes for resources in networks; resource addressing in
network operating systems

 Security considerations in local networks, network operating systems,
and distributed systems.

 computational complexity, intractability, class-complete reductions,
algorithms and efficiency


.I 22

 I am interested in hidden-line and hidden-surface algorithms for
cylinders, toroids, spheres, and cones.  This is a rather specialized
topic in computer graphics.

 Concurrency control mechanisms in operating systems


.I 27
.W
 Memory management aspects of operating systems


.I 28
.W
 Any information on packet radio networks.  Of particular interest are
algorithms for packet routing, and for dealing with changes in
network topography.  I am not interested in the hardware used in the
network.


.I 29
.W
 Number-theoretic algorithms, especially involving prime number series,
sieves, and Chinese Remainder theorem.


.I 30

 Articles on text formatting systems, including "what you see is what you
get" systems.  Examples: t/nroff, scribe, bravo.


.I 31

 I'd like to find articles describing the use of singular value decomposition
in digital image processing.  Applications include finding approximations
to the original image and restoring images that are subject to noise. An
article on the subject is H.C. Andrews and C.L. Patterson "Outer product
expansions and their uses in digital image processing", American Mathematical
Monthly, vol. 82.

 I'd like to find articles describing graph algorithms that are based on
the eigenvalue decomposition (or singular value decomposition) of the
ajacency matrix for the graph.  I'm especially interested in any heuristic
algorithms for graph coloring and graph isomorphism using this method.


.I 33
.W
 Articles about the sensitivity of the eigenvalue decomposition of real
matrices, in particular, zero-one matrices.  I'm especially interested in
the separation of eigenspaces corresponding to distinct eigenvalues.
Articles on the subject:
C. Davis and W.M. Kahn, "The rotation of eigenvectors by a permutation:,
SIAM J. Numerical Analysis, vol. 7, no. 1 (1970); G.W. Stewart, "Error
bounds for approximate invariant subspaces of closed linear operators",
