NOTES ON HOMEWORK #2
====================

0) You can run the sample program as follows:

      perl vectror1.prl

--------------------------------------------------------- 

1) Calculation of Precision and Recall - a very brief summary

  Step 1 - Rank all the documents in the corpus by their
           similarity scores (for the given query).

  Step 2 - Determine the position in this list of the
           *relevant* documents for the query. Call this
           position the "rank" of the relevant documents.

  For example, consider the case where there are 8 relevant
  documents, which are ranked by your system as 
  (1,2,3,6,16,54,230,2664).
  
  Step 3  - compute a list of recall and precision values
            as follows for (i=1..TOTAL_RELEVANT)

		REC_i =  i / TOTAL_RELEVANT
 
                PREC_i = i / Rank_i 
      
    i =   1  Rank=    1  REC= 0.125  PREC= 1.000  Doc#= 3075
    i =   2  Rank=    2  REC= 0.250  PREC= 1.000  Doc#= 2266
    i =   3  Rank=    3  REC= 0.375  PREC= 1.000  Doc#= 1601
    i =   4  Rank=    6  REC= 0.500  PREC= 0.667  Doc#= 2973
    i =   5  Rank=   16  REC= 0.625  PREC= 0.312  Doc#= 2714
    i =   6  Rank=   54  REC= 0.750  PREC= 0.111  Doc#= 3156
    i =   7  Rank=  230  REC= 0.875  PREC= 0.030  Doc#= 3175
    i =   8  Rank= 2664  REC= 1.000  PREC= 0.003  Doc#= 2664

   If you want to compute precision at a recall value
   not listed in your table (e.g. 0.200), interpolate between
   known values (0.125 and 0.250). In the case of recall
   values less than the minimum computed (e.g. 0.100 < 0.125), 
   extrapolate from the slope of the two lowest recall values 
   computed (e.g. 0.125 and 0.250). 

   Your code should not die on the case where there is only
   1 relevant document.
   
--------------------------------------------------------- 

2)  Note that the value of $corpus_freq{$term} is not used
    in the program, but may be used by you in an extended term weighting
    method. $corpus_freq{$term} is the total number of times the word
    occurs in the corpus, while the $doc_freq{$term} is the total
    number of documents containing the term.
      
--------------------------------------------------------- 

3) Notes on Part 3 - mostly a summary of what has been said in class

    - If you are interested in using SVD, there is a code
      package (SVDPACK) in the course directory. The C version
      is in the subdirectory 'svdpackc'. See guide.ps.

      Some very good papers on SVD are:

   http://www.cs.utk.edu/~library/TechReports/1994/ut-cs-94-270.ps.Z
   http://www.cs.utk.edu/~berry/sc95/sc95.html


   - If you are interested in using a thesaurus for term expansion,
     a copy of Roget's thesaurus (1911 edition) is located in
     the 'thesaurus' subdirectory. See 'README' for notes on the
     subject and a simple method of using the code.


   - Adding bigrams to the vector models is relatively straightforward.

     As noted in class, you can easily generate a list of bigrams
     by the unix command:

       tail +2 cacm.tokenized | paste cacm.tokenized - 

     You could feed this through make_hist.prl and treat it as
     a second corpus (like the stemmed version), with the additional
     constraint that a bigram is considered a "stopword" if either
     of the two words in the bigram are stopwords.

     However, you will achieve better performance if you include
     both unigrams and bigrams in your vector models. This is also
     straightforward to do. Just write a simple Perl program to 
     print a stream of the following form (with both unigrams and 
     bigrams, and treat this just as a stream of tokens in a
     new expanded document. 

                ----------------
		.I 1
		.T
		preliminary
		report
		-                   ==>
		international
		algebraic
		language
		.A
		perlis
                ----------------

                ------------------------------
		.I 1
		.I 1          .T
		.T
		.T            preliminary
		preliminary
		preliminary   report
		report
		report        -
		-
		-             international
		international
		international algebraic
		algebraic
		algebraic     language
		language
		language      .A
		.A
		.A            perlis 
		perlis
		perlis        ,
                ------------------------------

   makehist.prl will compute corpus and document frequencies
   for both the unigram and bigram tokens (without modification),
   and in the simplest implementation you can do term weighting 
   ignoring whether a token is a unigram or bigram (except in
   the case of stopword pruning).

   Note: For ease of processing, you may want to replace the tab character
   in the bigram with a character like '_' (e.g. 'algebraic	language'
   ==> 'algebraic_language'.
            

--------------------------------------------------------- 

Finally, note that when evaluating your work in part 3, I will
be interested both in the creativity/substance of your extension
AND the quantitative performance improvement it achieves. 
Don't avoid interesting extensions simply because you are afraid
that they won't improve performance, but do aim for as much
of a quantitative improvement as possible.
