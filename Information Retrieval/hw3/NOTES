respectively. For example:

                       tank   plant  pers/place

   .....


Combinations you should use are:


             Position       Local Collocation

        SUGGESTED EXTENSIONS FOR EXTRA CREDIT
        =====================================

You are strongly encourage to implement one or
more of the following extensions for up to 50 points 
extra credit (commensurate with the substance
and quality of the work).

(1) IMPLEMENT A SIMPLE BAYESIAN MODEL FOR SENSE DISAMBIGUATION

Although superficially very different, it is relatively 
straightforward to implement a simple Bayesian classifier
assuming independence using the existing vector infrastructure.

Below is a suggested outline of the steps you may follow:

(a) create vectors for all of the 4000 contexts as in the
    vector model, but DON'T weight the terms by TF*IDF.
    Either use simple term frequency (TF) for the vector
    values, or a region weighting of your choice.
    You should exclude stopwords and stemming may be helpful.

(b) create V_sum1 and V_sum2, containing the sum of all
    the vectors assigned to sense 1 or 2 respectively.
    This is identical to the process of computing
    V_profile1 and V_profile2 in the vector model,
    except that you don't divide by the number of vectors.
    
   
(c) For all $term in V_sum2, compute the LogLikelihood ratio:

       if ($Vsum1{$term} > 0)
          $LLike{$term} = log ( $Vsum1{$term} / $Vsum2{$term} ) 
       else
          $LLike{$term} = log ( $EPSILON / $Vsum2{$term} ) 


    For all $term in V_sum1 and NOT IN V_sum2 (i.e. the rest)

          $LLike{$term} = log ( $Vsum1{$term} / $EPSILON) ) 

       [ note that there is no need to test if $Vsum{$term} > 0
         in this case, as this result is implied if
         $V_sum2{$term} <= 0; ]

     In this very simple smoothing model, set $EPSILON 
     to a value such as .2. You may perform more sophisticated
     smoothing procedures if you so choose.
    

(d)  A simple way to classify new test vectors ($vtest) is as follows:


       For each $term in $Vtest:

           $sumofLL += $LLike{$term} * $Vtest{$term};

             (i.e. sum up the model's LogLikelihoods for those terms that
              appear the new test vector (not used to create the model
              initially).

           if ($sumofLL > 0) then  assign class 1
           if ($sumofLL < 0) then  assign class 2
           if ($sumofLL = 0) then  both classes equally likely.

           The larger the deviation of $sumofLL from 0, the larger
           our confidence in the classification of this test vector. 
         

           When reporting the results of each of these test vectors,
           print the true_class for the vector (found in .I <dn> <trueclass), 
           the precicted_class for the vector, the $sumofLL, and 
           the $titles[$dn] for that test case, much like you would
           do for the vector model.


If you have any questions about this procedure, please come see me.
============================================================================


(2) PERFORM WEAKLY SUPERVISED VARIANT OF THE PERSON/PLACE CLASSIFIER.

      Assume that you have no labelled training data for the
      person place classifier, but you WILL have large sets
      of unlabelled data (e.g. persons or places in context)
      AND a list of likely (and unambiguous) members of the
      respective classes. Assume that these proper names
      are indeed ambiguous and add as vectors to the training
      data for $Vprofile_1 or $Vprofile_2, respectively,
      just like for the fully supervised sense disambiguation
      case. The major problem here is that there is noise in
      this data, but if the example words are relatively
      unambiguous then it should be tolerable. 

      This is a simple but efficient learning procedure because
      it does not require hand labelled training data of
      persons or places in context, just lists of likely
      (unambiguous) persons or places *without pretagged contxts*.
     

      There are several ways this approach can be extended through
      the EM algorithm. If you are interested, please see me for
      details. Such an extension is not required.
     
    
============================================================================

(3) PERFORM A HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING OF THE SAMPLE SENSE VECTORS

       (using a software package of your choice -e.g. S-Plus). 

       Please see me for details.

       Each induced cluster will correspond to one (hypothesized)
       sense of subsense of the word.
