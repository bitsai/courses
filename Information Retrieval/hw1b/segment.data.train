PTEXT	The Minority & Women Doctoral Directory is pleased to announce the third annual
PTEXT	publication of the _Minority & Women Doctoral Directory_.  The Directory,
PTEXT	available September 20, 1992 and published in two volumes, is a national
PTEXT	listing of minority and women doctoral students who have recently received or
PTEXT	are soon to receive their doctoral degree from approximately two hundred major
PTEXT	research universities in the United States.  There has been a 10% increase in
PTEXT	student participation over last year's edition, with the new Directory listing
PTEXT	approximately 3,800 Black, Hispanic, American Indian, Asian American and women
PTEXT	students in nearly 80 fields in the sciences, engineering, and the social
PTEXT	sciences and the humanities.   New for 1992-93 are listings for nursing and
PTEXT	architecture, and the Directory continues to offer listings for MFA/DMA
PTEXT	students in the fine and performing arts.  Each entry includes name,
PTEXT	local/permanent address and telephone number(s), ethnicity, department and
PTEXT	areas of specialization, date of completion, dissertation title, and name and
PTEXT	address of the faculty advisor.  This year's entries also include, when
PTEXT	available, citizenship and current employment/postdoctoral appointments.
PTEXT	Entries are indexed by field of study.  
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The information for the Directory was collected over late spring and summer
PTEXT	1992 to insure accurate mailing addresses.  Only those students from last
PTEXT	year's Directory who updated their listing for the new edition are included.
PTEXT	As in past years, the Directory is available in two versions: either as a
PTEXT	complete two volume set or as 58 separately available Departmental Rosters.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	If you're interested in obtaining the Minority & Women Doctoral Directory, or

HEADL	 	The Theory and Practice of Realistic Object Recognition
#BLANK#

#BLANK#	
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The problem of model-based object recognition is a fundamental one in the
PTEXT	field of computer vision, and we believe that it represents a promising
PTEXT	direction for practical applications.  Realistic object recognition systems
PTEXT	need to be able to perform well with noisy inputs, and within reasonable time
PTEXT	bounds.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	In the first part of the talk,  we present an analytical study of the
PTEXT	performance of the geometric hashing method in the presence of noise.
PTEXT	Geometric hashing is a representative of  a class of algorithms that
PTEXT	facilitate object recognition in a computationally advantageous way.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	In the second part, we describe an interpretation of geometric hashing that
PTEXT	allows the algorithm to be viewed as a Bayesian approach to model-based object
PTEXT	recognition.  This interpretation, which is a new form of Bayesian-based model
PTEXT	matching, leads to well-justified formulas, and gives a precise weighted-voting
PTEXT	method for the evidence-gathering phase of geometric hashing. These formulas
PTEXT	replace traditional heuristically-derived methods for performing weighted
PTEXT	voting, and also provide a precise method for evaluating uncertainty.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Using the Concert/C language, we have implemented a prototype  distributed
PTEXT	object recognition system that employs our Bayesian matching ideas. The
PTEXT	computational platform is a small group of public workstations.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The resulting system is scalable and can recognize aircraft and automobile
PTEXT	models subjected to 2D rotation, translation, and scale changes in real-world
PTEXT	digital imagery. This is the first system of its kind that is scalable, uses
PTEXT	large databases, can handle noisy input data, works rapidly using readily
PTEXT	available computational resources, and exhibits excellent performance
PTEXT	with real-world, natural scenes.

QUOTED	>When is United Airlines set to take delivery of the 1st 777-100?
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	There is no such thing as a 777-100; United is due to take delivery of
PTEXT	their first 777-200 (a -222, to be precise) on May 15th.
#BLANK#	
QUOTED	>Is is due to fly out of SFO?
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The delivery flight will be from the Seattle area (either Boeing Field,
PTEXT	more properly King County, um, International(?), where Boeing's delivery
PTEXT	center is located, or Paine Field up in Everett, site of the wide-body
PTEXT	factory) to SFO.  Initial service has been discussed at length over in

PTEXT	be on June 7th, UA 921 LHR-IAD followed shortly thereafter by UA 910
PTEXT	DEN-ORD-IAD-LHR.  The next morning FRA will see its first 777 service

#BLANK#	
QUOTED	>Will there be an ER version (like 767-200-ER), or is it already
QUOTED	>classified for over-water transport?
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Boeing hopes to deliver the 777 with 180-minute ETOPS rating.  United
PTEXT	really needs at least 120-minute ETOPS to make it practical for the
PTEXT	trans-Atlantic flights, though it's possible to do it without ETOPS.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The current 777 is a bit tight on range for the longer overwater
PTEXT	routes, though, with around 5,000 miles as the limit.  The "B-market"
PTEXT	777 will appear next year with considerably greater range, probably
PTEXT	close to that of the 747-400 from what I've seen.
#BLANK#	
QUOTED	>IS it true the new super-jumbo jet from Boeing will be an extended,
QUOTED	>double-decker version of the 777 and not the 747-400?
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	No.  The 777 is already pushing engine technologies.  If the "super-
PTEXT	jumbo" is a derivative, it will be based on the 747-400.  Perhaps you
PTEXT	are thinking of the ideas for a totally new aircraft which would use
PTEXT	the 777's engines, albeit four of them.  For comparison, here are the
PTEXT	rough MGTOW in lbs of these aircraft:
#BLANK#	
TABLE	    777 (A-market, base)	  505,000

#BLANK#

PTEXT	First of all, I would just like to say how happy I am to find such a
PTEXT	newsgroup like this to exist on the internet...I have always been
PTEXT	fascinated by the airline industry, and hopefully someday to be a part of
PTEXT	it.  In the recent years, I have made several observations about the
PTEXT	airline industry in general, and I would like to receive some comment on
PTEXT	what them, whether they are correct or not;
#BLANK#	
ITEM	1. Why is it that US carriers going trans-pacific don't seem to be as
ITEM	   favorable in the eyes of Asian travelers? It seems that somehow US
ITEM	   carriers do not offer the same type of service, or at least, the level
ITEM	   of service is not comparable to that of Asian carriers.
#BLANK#	
ITEM	2. On trans-pacific flights, is it normal to have a refueling stop during
ITEM	   winter? Last Christmas I flew on a China Airlines flight to Taipei, and
ITEM	   had to stop over in Anchorage for refueling.  Noting that it was a
ITEM	   747-400, I thought the -400 was supposed to be able to fly non-stop...
#BLANK#	
ITEM	3. Why is it that such airlines like Singapore, Cathay Pacifi, and China
ITEM	   are able to post profits year after year while US carriers are
ITEM	   suffering? In fact...they give more to the passengers while the fare is
ITEM	   often lower than US carriers...
#BLANK#	
ITEM	Hmm...if only I can remember all of the things I have wanted to ask...
ITEM	Anyhow....One more thing..I flew on a new Taiwanese carrier called EVA
ITEM	Airways last summer...in their Economy Deluxe class, and thought it was
ITEM	the most excellent...Has anyone else flew on them? What do you think? and
ITEM	is their service similar to that of Virgin Atlantic's?

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	On the contrary, USAir probably is not happy at all about this growth.  
PTEXT	There are two basic reasons for BWI's fantastic growth since September 
PTEXT	1993.  First is Southwest's entry into and expansion of BWI service.  
PTEXT	Second is the growth in traffic by other carriers -- especially USAir -- 
PTEXT	that are forced to match Southwest's low fares in order to maintain 
PTEXT	market share.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I haven't studied the issue, but I suspect that USAir's yield -- revenue
PTEXT	per revenue passenger mile -- has dropped at BWI because of the Southwest
PTEXT	service, relatively limited in scope as it is. Also, Southwest has slowly 
PTEXT	expanded the number of markets served out of BWI, and USAir clearly wants 
PTEXT	to keep that expansion in check.  For example, Southwest in late February 
PTEXT	announced a $39 fare for its nonstop service to Birmingham. USAir's 
PTEXT	response was not only to match the fare but to initiate nonstop service 
PTEXT	in the BWI-BHM market, where it previously had only connecting service.
#BLANK#	
QUOTED	: What about Philadelphia?  Is there any reason at all why they should
QUOTED	: keep PHL as a hub?  Aside from frequent service to Boston and some
QUOTED	: international routes, I see absolutely no value there.
#BLANK#	
QUOTED	: -sandeep
QUOTED	: -- 
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	PHL is an important part of what has traditionally been USAir's strategy
PTEXT	in the Northeast:  offer high frequency, jet service in business markets. 
PTEXT	The goal, of course, is to fill planes with business travelers willing to
PTEXT	pay a premium for same-day or overnight roundtrips.  For many years, USAir
PTEXT	also was able to count on leisure traffic as well because the airline
PTEXT	offered the most service. 
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Now, USAir is being hit on two fronts.  New carriers like Nations Air at
PTEXT	Philadelphia and (soon) Eastwind Airlines at nearby Trenton, N.J., are
PTEXT	threatening to cut into some of the key business markets.  ValuJet 
PTEXT	provides service to PHL from its Atlanta hub, connecting passengers to a 
PTEXT	number of other points, especially Flordia. In all these cases, the

PTEXT		Really?  My family is literally "forced" to take Philippine

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	There is no question about that fact.  RT fares between BWI and SFO
PTEXT	have dropped almost 25% since Southwest entered the market.  And
PTEXT	Southwest isn't even competitive fare-wise in that market (i.e.
PTEXT	Southwest has never been cheaper than the other carriers on this
PTEXT	route).  Indeed, it would appear that Southwest's presence has had a
PTEXT	flattening effect on almost all fares.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	... Well, all fares except, for example, BWI-RDU.  As soon as American
PTEXT	pulled out of that market, USAir doubled the round-trip fare.  
#BLANK#

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I've wondered about this move by USAir.  Here's a thought:  USAir's
PTEXT	yields between BWI-PIT, BWI-CLT, and BWI-PHL have traditionally been
PTEXT	very high.  BWI's non-stop service tends to center around Maryland,
PTEXT	Virginia, Florida, the Carribbean, and selected northeast cities.
PTEXT	Almost anything else requires a connection.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	If USAir has to charge $39 BWI-CLT-BHM-CLT-BHM, they are losing two
PTEXT	seats BWI-CLT and CLT-BWI ... two seats which they would otherwise sell
PTEXT	to higher fare tickets.  Given that USAir must match Southwest's fare
PTEXT	in the BWI-BHM-BWI market (so that they don't look like total wimps),
PTEXT	could they possibly be losing *less* by putting all of those low-fare
PTEXT	passengers on a non-stop to BHM, on a gamble that the BWI-CLT seats
PTEXT	will generate offsetting revenue?  Am I out to lunch here?

#BLANK#
PTEXT		Is there really any such thing? I have heard the two (variants)
PTEXT	of the 777 referred to only as 'A market' and 'B market', and I 
PTEXT	have sometimes heard the B market version referred to as 777-200B (although
PTEXT	not from very reliable sources). If the designations were -100 and -200,
PTEXT	I am sure that that is what AvWeek and the like (and Karl for that matter)
PTEXT	would have been using. Boeing seems to have stopped producing -100 variants
PTEXT	of their new planes. There are no 757-100 or 767-100 types, (Did these exist
PTEXT	in the planning stages?) and in the case of the last two aircraft that did 
PTEXT	come in -100 versions (the 737 and 747), these aircraft were rapidly phased
PTEXT	out in favour of the -200. Possibly Boeing has decided that a -100 series
PTEXT	aircraft is like version 1.0 of a software product, and has decided to 
PTEXT	solve the problem by not releasing them any more. (This is fine by me,
PTEXT	as long as we don't get Boeing 777-95). Perhaps someone who knows more about
PTEXT	this than I do could comment.

PTEXT		The 'can you imagine trying to evacuate this many people in a

PTEXT	has always come up whenever a substantially larger aircraft came into
PTEXT	being. Procedures have to be adapted to handle it, yes. Once in a while
PTEXT	you are going to get an accident in which 800 people die, yes. But,
PTEXT	if the average risk to a passenger on the new aircraft is the same
PTEXT	(or less) than on smaller aircraft, safety is not being compromised.
PTEXT	Fatalities will occur in larger clumps, yes, but this does not necessarily

#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	   In his presentation at Northwestern on Shuttle by United, Sky Magary
PTEXT	outlined the reasons for the creation of Shuttle and fit with the rest of
PTEXT	the airline. A summary of his points follows.
#BLANK#	 
#BLANK#	 
HEADL	WHY SHUTTLE HAD TO BE TRIED
#BLANK#	 
ITEM	1) California was Strategicaly Important to UA
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	Historically, 50% of UA's Origin/Destination/Connecting traffic was in the
PTEXT	western US.  UA's western strength was strategically important in
PTEXT	competing with American Airlines which was traditionally strong in the
PTEXT	East.
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	In 1991 UA had 50% of the local market share in California.  In that same
PTEXT	year, WN entered all of UA's traditional markets except SFO.  By 1994 UA
PTEXT	had abandonned every route which did not attach to a long haul route.  Its
PTEXT	cost per ASM was US$.11 versus $.075 for WN.
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	UA faced the prospect of losing high-margin long haul markets to AA if it
PTEXT	could not shore up the West coast feeds.
#BLANK#	 
ITEM	2) California has good densities.
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	By UA's estimate, only 1/4 of US markets are suited to point-to-point
PTEXT	service (more on the implications of this for WN in another post)  Of
PTEXT	these dense markets, only the ones in the West allowed free entry.  The
PTEXT	dense eastern markets had slot-controlled airports at least one endpoint.
PTEXT	To UA this implies both that California was the right place to offer
PTEXT	point-to-point and that unless slot restrictions are removed, the East
PTEXT	will never be a suitable Shuttle market.
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	What is a good, dense market?  By UA's estimate, there are 12
PTEXT	point-to-point markets in Califoria which have more than 1000 PDEW
PTEXT	(passengers per day, each way)
#BLANK#	 
HEADL	TO MAKE SURE THAT SHUTTLE WOULD WORK...
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	UA really agonized over all the operational details of it shuttle [my
PTEXT	note: unlike CO which simply copied WN]
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	1) UA chose gates close to the runway, not close to the landside, to
PTEXT	minimize taxi time
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	2) UA changed pilot checkoff procedures, recognizing that a plane that was
PTEXT	on the ground many times a day would have a different maintenance feedback
PTEXT	loop than a plane flown cross country.
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	3) UA implemented their WILMA boarding procedure (Window, Middle, Aisle).
PTEXT	This had the interesting side effect of balancing demand between window
PTEXT	and aisle seats. SInce they board first, window pax get to hog the
PTEXT	overhead bins, while aisle customers get the traditional easy-in-easy-out
PTEXT	advantage. In operation WILMA allows a 126 passenger 737 to be boarded in
PTEXT	10-13 minutes and in experiments they've been able to board a 195 seat 175
PTEXT	in 15 minutes.  (They have no plans to add 757 to shuttle at this time
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	4) Keep the travel agents happy. in OAK-LAX (the second biggest O&D market
PTEXT	for WN) UA offers 1/3 of the seats, but gets 50-55% of agency bookings.
#BLANK#	 
HEADL	WHAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE BETTER
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	5) About 1/3 of UA's premier customers don't like the new shuttle, either
PTEXT	because they had a set commuting pattern or because they don't see the
PTEXT	benefit of lower prices (their business paid). On the other hand 2/3
PTEXT	prefer the lower fares and better frequency of the Shuttle. Magary says
PTEXT	that UA should have done a special mailing to its premiers (rather than an
PTEXT	insert in the FF mailings) which wouldh have explained all of Shuttle's
PTEXT	changes (like how the longer walk to gates close to the runway would save
PTEXT	taxi time)
#BLANK#	 
HEADL	RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	6) They may experiment with a simpler [and I bet much cheaper] paint
PTEXT	scheme on a few new 737's  it retained the blue striped tail and blue
PTEXT	belly, but had a light fuselage [probably to cut air conditioning and
PTEXT	painting costs] and script Shuttle logo
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	7) UA is satisfied with the ability of Shuttle to feed pax to the rest of
PTEXT	the UA system--either through frequent flier loyalty or direct
PTEXT	connection.  Shuttle handles $360M worth of pax shared with the rest of
PTEXT	UA's system [the kind of figure that the folks in Finance love, but no one
PTEXT	knows what it means]
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	8) Shuttle's cost per ASM is now below .08 and they've told the analysts
PTEXT	they expect it to be down to .076 by the end of the year.
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	9) UA is consciously collecting the "historical premium" from last-minute
PTEXT	travellers which travel from SFO commands. Since folks have been
PTEXT	conditioned to pay more out of SFO, UA sees no reason to cut prices to
PTEXT	compete with SJC or OAK.  At the same time, UA is keeping OAK and SFO
PTEXT	prices more competitive for advance purchases.
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	10)The California competitors are currently matching prices and flooding
PTEXT	the market with capacity.  As some of that capacity is wrung out by
PTEXT	competition (as UA's was from OAK-ONT), expect to see it redeployed in
PTEXT	markets like SFO-PDX and xxx-PHX or LAS.  However, due to the needs of the
PTEXT	Denver hub (and its profits from traditional service) don't expect to see
PTEXT	much expansion of Shuttle outside of West Coast markets.

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	   Sky Magary, President of Shuttle by United, in his speech at NU alluded
PTEXT	to the limits on point-to-point service.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	   He asserted that only about 1/4 of US markets can support direct
PTEXT	service and most of these are on the West Coast.  Since this implied that
PTEXT	WN was serving many non-point-to-point markets with point-to-point
PTEXT	service, I asked him to explain the discrepancy.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	   He believes that at PHX, STL, MCI, and DTW, Souhtwest is dependant on
PTEXT	connecting (or multi-stop) passengers--that is to say most of the people
PTEXT	who are on a plane in these cites are either just passing through or will
PTEXT	be on the flight for more than just the first leg out of the city. The
PTEXT	hubbed airlines have realized this and have begun to match WN's one-stop
PTEXT	service with good connections at comparable prices via their hubs.  
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	   This is one of the unseen sources of pressure on WN's bottom line: all
PTEXT	that service WN added in the midwest and east relies on one-stop and
PTEXT	multi-stop passengers to fill the planes.  
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	   We tend only to see how WN competes in its traditional non-stop markets
PTEXT	(CA and TX).  We tend to focuson WN's high frequencies and low prices on
PTEXT	non-stops because they are few and easy to track and WN tells us they are
PTEXT	a point-to-point airline.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	    But the real fight with WN in the east and midwest is in all those
PTEXT	connecting markets where only those with advanced computer systems can
PTEXT	really see how connections can systematically beat one-stops and
PTEXT	multi-stops. Perhaps this is why Northwest went to three daily
PTEXT	omnidirectional banks at its MEM hub--to maximize its ability to put
PTEXT	connecting passengers on flights versus WN's  one-stops.

PTEXT	As WN grows, more connections become possible and so they will clearly

PTEXT	that the traditionals are only now waking up to the fact that they
PTEXT	compete with WN on these routes.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Incidently, how does this mesh (if it does at all) with the following
PTEXT	fact:  In its latest schedule, WN has a plethora (maybe 10 or more) of
PTEXT	one-stops from Chicago Midway to Houston Hobby.  They have to be carrying
PTEXT	enough traffic in the market that they'd benefit from putting on at least a
PTEXT	couple of nonstops.  So why don't they?  (Don't tell me they're afraid
PTEXT	of CO, Kevin, I can't believe that's it(*)).  There are other places where

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Why does a connection beat a onestop?  A onestop would seem to be better
PTEXT	than a connection---less chance of lost luggage for one thing!  No
PTEXT	running around a terminal, etc.  And WN onestops spend much less time
PTEXT	on the ground than any connection, so you'd figure there is a speed
PTEXT	advantage too.  I've never seen any particular charm in a 40 minute

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I'm sure they are paying attention, but I'm not ready to count either of
PTEXT	them among long-term surviors just yet.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	According to this months Air Transport World, Frontier's November load
PTEXT	factor was in the mid 30's.  Granted they are still rather new, but that's
PTEXT	clearly far below breakeven for a 737.  If they keep adding new cities month
PTEXT	after month without making sure that the old ones are profitable, pretty
PTEXT	soon they won't serve any cities.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	As for Western Pacific, I'm very, very skeptical about a Colorado Springs
PTEXT	hub.  Airports serving areas with two and three times the customer base that
PTEXT	COS has have failed to support real hubs.  If they are depending on lots of
PTEXT	connecting traffic, they should take a lesson from what happened in Kansas
PTEXT	City, Raleigh, Dayton, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Dulles and several other
PTEXT	places.  WestPac hopes to draw lots of traffic from Denver, but that's much
PTEXT	easier said than done.  There's no real precendence of this ever happening
PTEXT	before.  Some will surely make the drive from Denver to COS, but will it be
PTEXT	anywhere near enough to support an airline hub??  Finally, WestPac's short
PTEXT	list of near-term expansion includes such bustling routes as COS-Omaha and
PTEXT	COS-Oklahoma City.  NOW I know what happened to the genius route planners
PTEXT	that CALite canned.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Lastly a discouraging bit of anecdotal WestPac information.  A close friend
PTEXT	in San Francisco saw a WestPac ad which mentioned some great intorductary
PTEXT	fares on routes which included SFO-COS-Kansas City.  When my friend
PTEXT	*finally* got through to an agent, she said they didn't serve those cities.
PTEXT	My friend mentioned the SFO ad, and she then noted that SFO service was to
PTEXT	begin on 5/8.  Too bad...the ad said the introductary fares were only good
PTEXT	4/30 through 5/7.  Hmmmm...is this yet another start-up airline which is

PTEXT	Speaking of TPE-JFK, it has been rumored that CAL will switch to 
PTEXT	MD-11s on this flight. Wonder what kinda effect that will have on the 
PTEXT	range and the frequency of refueling stops in ANC.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Going back to refueling stops, whether a plane can fly to a particular place 
PTEXT	on a given day depends on  the payload and the weather.  If the weather 
PTEXT	is good (tail winds) then  the allowable payload is higher.  If the 
PTEXT	weather is bad (head winds) then the allowable payload is lower.  The 
PTEXT	flight dispatch people calculate  this figure for every flight and this 
PTEXT	plus the fuel onboard plus  the dead weight of the airplane cannot exceed 
PTEXT	a certain figure called the  maximum takeoff weight, which depends on the 
PTEXT	type of aircraft and the  runway it's using.  the parameters have to be 
PTEXT	balanced,  and if they're not the flight can't be released.  in cases of bad 
PTEXT	weather if the payload you need to carry is so large (full load of 
PTEXT	passengers, for example) that you exceed the  allowable payload, then you 
PTEXT	have to decrease the fuel onboard to stay in balance, which means 
PTEXT	you won't have enough to fly nonstop hence the stop in ANC.  
#BLANK#

PTEXT	that's a very rough explanation...those of you more familiar with flight 
PTEXT	operations please feel free to correct.

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I don't think any of these airlines are goverment subsidized.
PTEXT	I think it's the lack of competition in their home countries, except for 
PTEXT	CAL (which still made a marginal profit last year, despite the crash at NGO
PTEXT	and increased competition from EVA.)  Plus the fact that these carriers all 
PTEXT	are countries with very good economies that lead to increased travel, 
PTEXT	both in foreigners needing to go visit these countries and in the 
PTEXT	citizens who have more money for airline tickets.  Also, having rights to 
PTEXT	lucrative short-haul routes helps (CI and CX the TPE-HKG golden route, 
PTEXT	and SQ the SIN-KUL shuttle)  That's where all the profits are, the short 
PTEXT	haul routes.

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The problem is the mini-deal that goes around the bilateral. Giving UA 
PTEXT	exception rights in the ORD-LHR market can be (and is) viewed as 
PTEXT	preferential treatment. I believe that UA did have the option of getting 
PTEXT	rights to LGW and turned them down. I also agree that if the mini-deal 
PTEXT	gives UA access to their largest hub, that AA should get similar access 
PTEXT	from DFW, their largest hub, and DL should get access from ATL, their 
PTEXT	largest hub.... Both DL and AA are allowed to serve only LGW from ATL and 
PTEXT	DFW respectively. UA is not alone in their inability to serve LHR from 
PTEXT	their largest hub. In fact, it seems to be the rule with the UK-US bilateral.

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Not where have we been, but where have you been? AA fought for six route 
PTEXT	authories in 1990, and received one. They were granted the preliminary 
PTEXT	approval for ORD-NRT, and then UA played a political card and had the 
PTEXT	route awarded to them. Not a bad move on UA's part, but the prelim award 
PTEXT	to AA was made in the interest of more competition. By reversing the 
PTEXT	route award, the DOT helped to lock competition to UA and NW. DL received 
PTEXT	the awards it was seeking in the LAX-NRT and PDX-NRT market, FedEx 
PTEXT	received a SFO-NRT award, AA received the SJC-NRT award, HP was awarded 
PTEXT	HNL-FUK (yep. not a typo...) and UA received the ORD-NRT award.
#BLANK#	
QUOTED	: Oh, BTW, they want continuing service from Osaka to Hong Kong, Seoul,

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Been talked about for years... Don't know if it will work without open

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	With all due respect to UA, TW and NW, the international route authorities 
PTEXT	are granted by political appointees, and not neccesarily based on 
PTEXT	competition, demand, or the ability of a carrier to serve the route. NW 
PTEXT	was able to secure a foothold in the Pacific Rim due to the post-WW2 
PTEXT	bilateral that was more or less imposed upon Japan by the US. Pan Am was 
PTEXT	able to decide where it flew: getting approval from the respective 
PTEXT	governments was a formality. UA was able to retain those rights when they 
PTEXT	bought Pan Am's Pacific and LHR operations. TWA was granted most of their 
PTEXT	trans-Atlantic route authorities before WW2, and the remainder given as a 
PTEXT	way of balancing Pan Am's dominance as a result of their 1950 purchase of 
PTEXT	American Overseas from none other than AA. None of these carrier had to 
PTEXT	submit any applications or go through a route award process for these 
PTEXT	rights. 
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	By allowing UA access to LHR from ORD through a mini-deal, the efforts of 
PTEXT	other carriers who have either purchased authorities or gone throught eh 
PTEXT	route case process are ignored. The DOT needs to be somewhat responsible 
PTEXT	and equitable: the UA mini-deal does not do either.

PTEXT	Good timing on the fleet-size question!  FedEx is the cover story of

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Not mentioned in the article -- and not part of the revenue fleet --
PTEXT	are 5 biz jets, a Cessna Citation V plus four Canadair Challengers.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	That's a pretty sizeable fleet, but it's still well short of the big
PTEXT	guys.  According to an article in today's WSJ, United had 543 aircraft
PTEXT	in its fleet at the close of 1994.  American's fleet is even bigger,
PTEXT	with 652 aircraft according to Eric Olesen's Airline History WWW page.
PTEXT	British Airways is puny in comparison, with around 250 aircraft.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Note, though, that less than half of the FedEx consists of jets, with
PTEXT	the bulk consisting of the turbo-prop powered F27s and Cessna 208s.
PTEXT	American, United, and British Airways have entirely jet fleets; their

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Today's Wall St. Journal has an article on page A2 about United's
PTEXT	scaled back fleet expansion plans.  Gerald Greenwald, chairman and
PTEXT	CEO of United, told analysts that the airline now plans a net
PTEXT	addition of 19 aircraft between now and the end of 1997 instead of
PTEXT	a net addition of 48 aircraft under an earlier plan.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The article goes on to note that United's fleet has a relatively
PTEXT	low average age of 10 years, but about 8% of their planes are 25
PTEXT	years old or older.  It also breaks down the 94 aircraft expected
PTEXT	to be retired by the end of 1999:
#BLANK#	
ITEM	  - 18 747s -- Presumably the entire 747-100 fleet, which includes
ITEM		13 ancient 747-122s that United bought new and another three
ITEM		even more elderly, ex-American 747-123s.  The article claims
ITEM		these aircraft won't meet noise standards, yet the seven ex-
ITEM		Qantas 747-238Bs aren't much better.
#BLANK#	
ITEM	  - 31 DC-10s -- I'm afraid I've lost track of how many DC-10s United
ITEM		has retired thus far.  This undoubtedly covers the entire
ITEM		DC-10-10 fleet, but I'm not sure if it includes the eight-
ITEM		member DC-10-30 fleet or not.  The latter aircraft are based
ITEM		in Honolulu, I believe, and except for HNL-ORD non-stops and
ITEM		occasional trips to SFO for maintenance they mainly fly to
ITEM		and within Southeast Asia.
#BLANK#	
ITEM	  - 45 737-200s -- All of the remaining 737-222s, but not the 24-
ITEM		member fleet of 737-200 Advanced aircraft acquired from the
ITEM		original Frontier in the late 1980s.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The most interesting part of the article was reading between the lines.
PTEXT	The above retirement list totals 94 aircraft, which means even if no new
PTEXT	planes arrive between the end of 1997 and 2000, United expects to take
PTEXT	delivery of 113 new aircraft.  However, their current firm orders total
PTEXT	only 58 aircraft -- 24 A320 deliveries are still outstanding from the
PTEXT	firm order for 50, and 34 777s are on firm order.  What might the other
PTEXT	55 aircraft be?
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The WSJ article only hints at what else might in the works, saying that
PTEXT	a Boeing spokesman had confirmed talkes about new orders between Boeing
PTEXT	and United.  It doesn't mention the 50 A320 options nor the 34 777
PTEXT	options.  I think there are also additional 747-400 orders and options
PTEXT	still on the books, though that got shuffled around a lot several years
PTEXT	ago when United wanted to cancel some 777 orders.  (I've also heard
PTEXT	that United has expressed interest in picking up several more 747-400s
PTEXT	if they become available with quick deliveries and good prices, like
PTEXT	the two that Northwest cancelled in 1993 and United picked up last
PTEXT	year.)
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	A more interesting proposition might be an order for more 737s.  United
PTEXT	has already said that they expect Shuttle by United to make money this
PTEXT	year, and despite retrenchments in a few markets they're growing quite
PTEXT	rapidly.  They "only" have a pool of 101 737-300s and around 60 -500s
PTEXT	that must not only support Shuttle flights but, along with the -200s,
PTEXT	all of United's shorter flights.  Don't forget the pending retirement
PTEXT	of the 45 737-222s, so while demand is increasing, supply is going down
PTEXT	to the tune of almost 20% of their 230 aircraft 737 fleet.  If Shuttle
PTEXT	continues to grow, United *must* buy additional small aircraft, and the
PTEXT	737 in some flavor is the obvious choice.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	At the other end of the spectrum, the 747-100s supplement the -400s in
PTEXT	the Pacific markets (as the "small" aircraft!) and the 767 fleet on the
PTEXT	heavy routes across the Atlantic (from the east coast -- they don't
PTEXT	have the range to fly California-Europe) and also down to South
PTEXT	America.  777s will probably take over the latter routes, while the
PTEXT	Pacific routes can be handled by additional 747-400s or 747-238Bs freed
PTEXT	from Atlantic routes.  That still leaves all those DC-10 shoes to be
PTEXT	filled, and there simply aren't enough 777s on order to do all of the
PTEXT	work.  Flights that used to rate a DC-10 or 767 from the west coast to
PTEXT	the east coast or Chicago now get a 757 or even an A320, so maybe they
PTEXT	just plan on downsizing these domestic routes, but I wonder how far
PTEXT	they can go with this.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	My only conclusion at this point, other than that it will be interesting
PTEXT	to  watch it all unfold, is that it might be a good time to buy Boeing
PTEXT	stock!  :-)

PTEXT	While this may be a creative thought, IMHO I don't think airlines generally
PTEXT	schedule flights for the sake of arriving at their destinations at a
PTEXT	convenient time necessarily.  In India for example, all European flights arrive
PTEXT	and depart between around 11pm and 4am.  Indeed, some of the busiest hours at
PTEXT	Bombay and Delhi airports are in the very late hours of the night and wee hours
PTEXT	of the morning.  This happens because the airlines want the flights departing
PTEXT	from Europe to leave at a convenient time (so that connecting passengers can
PTEXT	make the flight without waiting many hours).  Thus, a typical US-India route on
PTEXT	a European carrier might be something like:  Leave Chicago at 5pm, arrive in
PTEXT	Frankfurt at 10am, leave for Bombay at 2pm, and arrive in Bombay at 1am.  There
PTEXT	are exceptions to this.  British Airways' London-Bombay flight leaves Heathrow
PTEXT	at 10pm and gets into Bombay around 7 or 8 the next morning, but this also
PTEXT	means passengers connecting from trans-Atlantic flights have to wait 9-12 hours
PTEXT	in the airport.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I've always been amazed how my aunt in Bombay can put up with picking up
PTEXT	relatives at the airport at 2am every few months or so.

PTEXT	T-1 should be all WN.  HP should be moved to T-6 with CO, space providing.  I

PTEXT	Well, for starters, the only current Chapter 11 carrier is Mark Air,
PTEXT	which isn't all that big a carrier. A bunch of carriers have used
PTEXT	chapter 11 to restructure. Arguing that the industry would be happier
PTEXT	without those carriers in business is hard to do, as what ifs are always
PTEXT	somewhat a matter of opinion. But, I'd point out that the history of
PTEXT	what happens to domestic carriers as they go belly up is that low
PTEXT	cost carriers spring up in thier markets and the remaning majors
PTEXT	move in on the markets from thier own strongholds. Both of these
PTEXT	activities can lead to farewars. 
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Fare wars have been waged by both the previous chapter 11 carriers
PTEXT	when they were (and were not) under chapter 11 protection and the
PTEXT	non chapter 11 carriers. The economics of the airline industry are
PTEXT	very nasty. The major carriers found out just how nasty when
PTEXT	deregulation struck. While some did better than others, all hit
PTEXT	pretty rough going. 
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	As long as you have a large number of seats chasing after a smaller
PTEXT	number of customers, and it's better to make some money then no money
PTEXT	from a customer, the airlines will have an incentive to offer fares
PTEXT	right down to the incremental cost to carry the additional body. 
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The industry, as a whole has been slowly shedding capacity, as the
PTEXT	various players deal with some of the realities of the marketplace. This,
PTEXT	coupled with growth in travel, has given the industry as a whole some
PTEXT	relief. (As has a mjor focus on productivity, better route management,
PTEXT	more efficient scheduling, etc) 
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	All of the efforts to cut capacity and be more efficient won't help
PTEXT	much as long as people can enter cheaply and run at very low margins.
PTEXT	There's no reason to imagine that this won't happen. As you point out,
PTEXT	there are plenty of airplanes to be had cheap. One can imagine the
PTEXT	ongoing scenario of people opening up little low cost carriers, running
PTEXT	thier planes into the ground as they make just enough profit to keep
PTEXT	in business, but not enough to cover the cost of new planes. At the
PTEXT	same time, they lower the profitability of all thier compeitors as well,
PTEXT	keeping it hard for them to replace planes. 
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Since there's no bar to entry (Unless your last name is Lorenzo) 
PTEXT	anyone can do this in any market, and they only have to convince
PTEXT	thier backers they might make enough money to pay off their loans. 
PTEXT	Of course, as far as I can tell, every business plan ever offered
PTEXT	to the banks is optimistic (Probably a requirement to start a
PTEXT	business in the first place) The industry is littered with
PTEXT	optimists who didn't realize how hard it is to make money and how
PTEXT	easy it is to lose money. 
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I don't think that you can blame Chapter 11 for all the industry's
PTEXT	ills. Stupidity, greed, pride, and people who spent 40 years in a
PTEXT	cozy, regulated industry trying to deal with a free market with
PTEXT	totally new dynamics all have a place when it comes to blame.

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Upgrade CVG to a Whopper Hub.  DL and OH (Comair/Delta Connection) are the
PTEXT	two largest airlines at CVG; DL's operations there are now larger than
PTEXT	either their DFW or SLC hubs.  CVG is even closing in on ATL in some ways,
PTEXT	with the expansion DL and OH have done.  (OH has their own 50+ gate
PTEXT	concourse, complete with a duty-free kiosk for their CRJ flights to
PTEXT	Canada.)  DL ads are now touting CVG as the "O'Hare Bypass", with better
PTEXT	weather, easier connections, and so forth.  (Interesting similarities here
PTEXT	to Western's old ads touting SLC as a better alternative to DEN, before
PTEXT	the merger.)
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	SLC is also gaining flights, mostly on SkyWest, another Delta Connection
PTEXT	carrier; both ComAir and SkyWest are flying larger and larger CRJ fleets,
PTEXT	picking up "thin" city routes from the hubs at SLC, CVG, and MCO (which is
PTEXT	getting several of Comair's CRJs).  The SkyWest concourse at SLC was also
PTEXT	recently expanded and renovated; though it's quite a bit smaller than OH's
PTEXT	Concourse C at CVG, it still has room for 16 or so gates.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	MCO is a minor hub not just from WDW traffic, but also because of the
PTEXT	substantial (and growing) Comair presence there.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	BOS should probably be added as a Vestigial Hub; DL does have a fairly
PTEXT	solid presence here, including one of the two Business Express (Delta
PTEXT	Connection *and* Northwest Airlink, now) hubs (JFK is the other) as well
PTEXT	as code-shared flights on SN to Brussels and VS to London-Gatwick.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Add PDX and LAX to the Vestigial Hubs list for their role in gatewaying
PTEXT	Pacific Rim traffic (and the SkyWest hub at LAX, for those of you who just
PTEXT	*love* EM2s).  They're probably at about the same level as JFK.
#BLANK#	
QUOTED	 KC> NW          MSP, DTW                          NRT (Tokyo) MEM
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I'd add BOS as a "bygone" Vestigial Hub, and add SEA which still had a
PTEXT	fairly hefty presence last I checked.  MEM probably could go to Minor Hub.
PTEXT	Other "bygones" could include MKE... I never did figure out why they were
PTEXT	trying to add another hub in the northern tier.
#BLANK#	
QUOTED	 KC> US          PIT,             CLT,             PHL, DCA, LGA, BWI, IND

PTEXT	BOS probably qualifies as at least a vestigial hub for US, who at times
PTEXT	seem to have made a vestigial hub out of every city in the northeast US
PTEXT	with a sizable airport.  (They're reportedly the passenger carrier with
PTEXT	the most flights per day from BOS.)

PTEXT	Monday's (4/17) Minneapolis Star Tribune business section contained a
PTEXT	typically content free (for the paper) story about Northwest Airlines,
PTEXT	the wage concessions, and how wonderful everything is. It did contain
PTEXT	an interesting graph showing costs per ASM for several airlines. Even
PTEXT	with the concessions, NW was near the highest at about 9.5 cents per
PTEXT	ASM, second only to USAir. For all airlines, costs were fairly similar
PTEXT	between 1993 and 1994. There were some brief footnotes, one of which
PTEXT	stated that NW's costs included "restructuring and ESOP costs". So
PTEXT	maybe these numbers are more indicative of where the cash costs will

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Why do some people prefer JFK over EWR?  It's all about prestige.  Gatwick
PTEXT	started life as almost a completely charter based airport.  It's now got 
PTEXT	a respectable amount of scheduled traffic, but it still suffers the old
PTEXT	stigma.  In terms of airline connections, it is nowhere near as well

PTEXT	are two terminals.  North (Just British Airways I think), and South 
PTEXT	(everyone else).  The South terminal has the direct connection to the 
PTEXT	trains, the north is connected to the South terminal by a people mover.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	As an airport, I like it.  You are right, the public transportation to 
PTEXT	London is probably superior (depending on exactly where you want to go).
PTEXT	The British rail station is connected with the airport, and there are direct
PTEXT	services to many parts of central London.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I have had differing levels of service at Gatwick, from excellent, to total 
PTEXT	shambles.  The last was thanks to those wonderful people at TWA, who made
PTEXT	a total mess of filling up a 747.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	My main reservations about the place is the single relatively short runway.
PTEXT	That same TWA flight, we only left the ground at the very very end of the 
PTEXT	runway.  Almost enough to make me give up on my window seat preference.

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	JFK is without a doubt the most insanely crappy airport in the United
PTEXT	States and possibly in the entire First World.  Every time I go through
PTEXT	there I am simply amazed at the complete shoddiness of the entire
PTEXT	operation, and the totally bungled "JFK 2000" project (now on hold
PTEXT	until 3000) has only added to the frustration and confusion of the
PTEXT	place.  Even some things which could be remedied without any hassle
PTEXT	whatsoever are left unattended -- for example, in the UA terminal,
PTEXT	why does the bar not take credit cards?  And I do not mean -- it 
PTEXT	does not take my favorite credit card, it just doesn't take them
PTEXT	period.  
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	So now to the question:  why do people prefer it?  I wondered about this
PTEXT	repeatedly during the ten years that I lived in the New York area, and
PTEXT	finally came up with four reasons:
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	* prestige from the past.  Crazy as it may seem, to many middle- and late-
PTEXT	middle-aged New Yorkers, international travel still means departing from
PTEXT	"Idlewild".  There is a nostalgic romance in their minds which the present
PTEXT	condition of the airport apparently does not shatter.  Add to this what
PTEXT	for many New Yorkers remains the "stigma" of New Jersey and these folks
PTEXT	will continue to choose JFK for international departures.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	* force of habit.  Believe it or not, it took many New Yorkers years to
PTEXT	realize that a build-up of international service had taken place at
PTEXT	EWR.  As a friend from northern New Jersey once commented, "Newark was
PTEXT	our little secret for years and years".  Once word began to get out,
PTEXT	many people took a long time to change their patterns.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	* orneriness.  Complaining about JFK is a full-time occupation for many
PTEXT	well-traveled New Yorkers.  EWR is simply too easy to use for the cranky
PTEXT	New York soul.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	* and finally a more "objective" reason.  A lot of the pax at JFK are not
PTEXT	coming from Manhattan (and therefore relatively equidistant from EWR and
PTEXT	JFK) but rather from Long Island.  JFK is their closest international
PTEXT	gateway (Islip has increasing domestic service but that's all).  Getting
PTEXT	from Long Island to New Jersey is a colossal hassle and for anyone living
PTEXT	in Nassau and certainly Suffolk counties, is not really a viable option.
PTEXT	There's a couple million people right there "captive" to JFK.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	To think that Angelenos complain about LAX...

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	If you just want to fly from the US to London or the South East of England
PTEXT	then from the passengers standpoint flying from Gatwick is generally a
PTEXT	pleasurable and logical choice to make. Gatwick is a major international
PTEXT	airport but has less than half the passengers of Heathrow which probably
PTEXT	gives it a reputation for being a bit more user friendly. Connections to
PTEXT	Central London are quick and easy from whichever terminal you arrive at
PTEXT	using the Gatwick Express rail service.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	>From the major international scheduled airline's point of view they're
PTEXT	going to want to use Heathrow every time. Heathrow captures more of the
PTEXT	business market and hence yields are higher. Heathrow historically and to
PTEXT	the presnt day has been a magnet for passengers and so you are more likely
PTEXT	to put a greater number of bums on seats out of Heathrow than Gatwick. In
PTEXT	terms of onward connections, Heathrow has a clear advantage over Gatwick
PTEXT	and this probabaly gives it it's greatest appeal to the international
PTEXT	passenger. BA obviously uses Heathrow as its major hub, but all operators
PTEXT	can utilize Heathrow's hubbing synergy through code-sharing, alliances,
PTEXT	etc..

PTEXT	You'll have to excuse me.  When I think of the Pacific I think naturally

PTEXT	I say CO pulling out of the Pacific, I am thinking of those markets.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I think there is good money to be made in LAX-AKL/SYD, yes.  QF, NZ and
PTEXT	UA are having a ball on those routes.  There is less competition there
PTEXT	than there has been in many a year.  Air NZ just took a 4th and 5th
PTEXT	747-400 to accomodate demand.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	What was lacking for CO was a long-legged jet, which AC has.  AC has
PTEXT	a small fleet of 747-400.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The point is that service by an American carrier to the South Pacific
PTEXT	is greatly enhanced if its feed is backed up by a guaranteed feed
PTEXT	from Canada.  Thus CO or HP service to the S.Pacific gets code-shared
PTEXT	with AC and you have CO/HP flight numbers going e.g. EWR-LAX-SYD/AKL

PTEXT	fuel vs. payload due to wieght limitations - therefore, you don't carry full
PTEXT	fuel if you don't expect to need it).
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	Another factor is destination weather and how close suitable alternates are. If
PTEXT	the weather at the destination is forecast to be bad and your alternate is two
PTEXT	hours away, then you may have to make a fuel stop to insure that you have the
PTEXT	needed fuel to go to your alternate if required.
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	Other factors can be conditions at your departure airport. Closure of the

PTEXT	conditions (e.g. slush or snow) and winds.

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Newsweek has just published a special report on air travel safety in the
PTEXT	United States, in the wake of a year in which more there more fatalities than 
PTEXT	in the previous four years combined.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	In the article, Newsweek detailed what it thinks are the major problems that
PTEXT	threaten safe air travel in the U.S.  Allow me to summarize:
#BLANK#	
ITEM		(1) Antiquated air traffic control system
ITEM			Some aspects of our system date to prewar times, such as 
ITEM			pilots flying over the Atlantic using high frequency radios 
ITEM			to speak to controllers in Islip to report flight progress 
ITEM			through a third party, thus slowing response time considerably,
ITEM			becasue the FAA lacks equipment that can follow a plane acros
ITEM			the Atlantic.
ITEM		(2) Wind Shear
ITEM			A problem that can be treated by the installation of Doppler 
ITEM			Radar Systems (TDWR), but has been hindered by environmental as
ITEM			well as political oppostion.  Doppler Technology is only in 
ITEM			place at IAH, MEM, and STL.  The FAA says that 47 additional 
ITEM			Dopplers will be working by 1996.  
ITEM		(3) Ice Buildup/Problems with De-Icing
ITEM			Ground delays causing ice buildup even after the aircraft has
ITEM			been de-iced because the chemical only protects the wings for
ITEM			fifteen minutes.  Problems with commuter aircraft is discussed
ITEM			as well.
ITEM		(4) Terrorism
ITEM			Yesterday's bombing in Oklahoma City is just another example of
ITEM			how vunerable the United States is to terrorist attacks.  The
ITEM			article maintains that it is very easy for a terrorist to bomb 
ITEM			a domestic flight, but suggests that they may not realize how 
ITEM			easy it is.  Technology to fight this would cost ridiculous 
ITEM			amounts of money.
ITEM		(5) Conflicts Between "Man and Machine"
ITEM			A certain aircraft manufacturer whose name starts with an "A"
ITEM			was mentioned several times in this section, with a United 
ITEM			pilot being quoted as saying "Why did it do that" in refrence
ITEM			to an action performed by his aircraft.
ITEM		(6) Ground Collisions/Traffic
ITEM			This topic ties into the first one, the fact that controllers
ITEM			lack equipment that can warn them of possible ground 
ITEM			collisions.  The window is the only way a controller can see
ITEM			aircraft on the ground now, and radar systems are being 
ITEM			pointed to as a method of warning controllers of impending
ITEM			accidents.  This technology is also very expensive, and has 
ITEM			some oppostion within the FAA. 			 			    
#BLANK#
PTEXT	The article goes on to elaborate on each of these issues, supported by
PTEXT	citations of disasters and the input of industry insiders.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The section concludes with a list of ten ways in which the air travel industry
PTEXT	can be made safer.  Those are:
#BLANK#	
ITEM		(1) immediate modernization of the Air Traffic Control System, 
ITEM		(2) taking control of the FAA away from Congress,
ITEM		(3) make the FAA enforce safety issues only, not economic ones,
ITEM		(4) improve flight data recording devices,
ITEM		(5) set higher standards for pilots,
ITEM		(6) increase the number of controllers,
ITEM		(7) eliminate "lap rides" for children under two and require 
ITEM		    safety seats for children,
ITEM		(8) improve airport security,
ITEM		(9) get Doppler technology up and running where it is most needed
ITEM		    immediately, and
ITEM		(10) listen to what fliers want.  According to a Newsweek poll, 71% 
ITEM		    of fliers would pay higher fares for safety improvements, and 
ITEM		    94% of those surveyed said they would tolerate delays and 
ITEM		    cancellations in favor of higher safety standards.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Another part of the article that caught my eye was Newsweek's own statistical 
PTEXT	ratings of the airlines, as far as safety is concerned.  Based on data from 
PTEXT	the last ten years, the rankings are as follows, with death risk:
#BLANK#	
TABLE		    American		0
TABLE		    Southwest		0
TABLE		    TWA			0
TABLE	     	    Continental		1 in 10 million
TABLE		    Delta		1 in 8 million
TABLE		    United		1 in 4 million
TABLE		    Northwest		1 in 3 million
TABLE		    USAir		1 in 2 million
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I compared these figures to the study presented in Newsweek's issue dated 
PTEXT	September 19, 1994, based on a twenty year test period.
#BLANK#	
TABLE		    Southwest		0
TABLE		    Continental		1 in 15 million
TABLE		    Delta		1 in 10 million
TABLE		    American		1 in 10 million
TABLE	            United		1 in 8 million
TABLE		    TWA			1 in 5 million
TABLE		    Northwest		1 in 4 million
TABLE		    USAir		1 in 2.5 million
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Numbers were also presented for a limited number of international carriers, 
PTEXT	with Air Canada, Quantas, El Al, British Airways, and Japan Air Lines being 
PTEXT	the safest.  
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I found the article to be quite interesting, but would have like to have seen 
PTEXT	the charts contain more information (i.e., more carriers).  I also found the 
PTEXT	descriptions of wind shear and icing to be particularly good, supported by 
PTEXT	excellent graphics.  
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	One problem that I had was seeing NW's low rating on both lists.  I can't 
PTEXT	remember a NW accident in the last five years.  In fact, the only one I 
PTEXT	remember is the DC-10 that crashed near DTW several years ago.  I have to be 
PTEXT	missing some, especially if their rating is so close to that of USAir's, for
PTEXT	whom I can name at least six accidents off the top of my head.  
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	All in all, I recommend the article to everyone who reads this newsgroup and 
PTEXT	anyone else who flies, not to intimidate them, but rather to inform them as 
PTEXT	to the state of air travel safety in the United States.  While the article may
PTEXT	not be totally objective or scientific, it will give you something to think
PTEXT	about.  
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I'm sorry about the length of this post.  I hope that it was found to be 
PTEXT	informative.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Happy, and above all, safe, flying to all.

QUOTED	>With United's varied 747 collection, each of the three fleets (1xx, 2xx, 4xx)

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	There are really five fleets -- the two flavors of -200B are quite
PTEXT	different, and there are two -400 configs.
#BLANK#	
QUOTED	>But within each of the three different fleets, can all the planes be
QUOTED	>interchanged, or are there some limitations on how these planes are flown?
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Within the *four* (or five) fleets, the aircraft are pretty much
PTEXT	interchangeable.
#BLANK#	
QUOTED	>- Do the 122s and 123s all fly the same routes?
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Yes.  Most have been upgraded to 750,000 lbs MGTOW though the last
PTEXT	data I saw said a few still were at 734,000 lbs.  This doesn't have
PTEXT	any correlation to -122 or -123; they're probably being upgraded at
PTEXT	their next D check.  The weight limit of some only seems to restrict
PTEXT	payload and not routes.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The -123s have the old three-window upper deck with a 19' upper cabin
PTEXT	instead of 25', which eliminates the upper galley and makes the cabin
PTEXT	a bit less comfortable, but otherwise the -122s and -123s of the same
PTEXT	weight are identical.
#BLANK#	
QUOTED	>- Do the 222s and 238Bs fly the same routes? (all seem out of SFO or NRT)
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The -222Bs and -238Bs are very different aircraft.  The -222Bs are
PTEXT	amongst the last 1st generation 747s built, and at 833,000 lbs MGTOW,
PTEXT	they're actually capable of higher weights than an Air France -400!
PTEXT	They are configured with a very premium mix of seats (35/134/124) and
PTEXT	generally stay on the JFK-NRT routes they were purchased for or switch
PTEXT	over the EWR-NRT depending on loads.  The only other route I've ever
PTEXT	seen one fly is EWR-SFO, presumably for maintenance.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The seven ex-Qantas -238Bs are, in contrast, fairly early examples, 12
PTEXT	years older than the two -222Bs, and even after several upgrade rounds
PTEXT	are only good for 800,000 lbs MGTOW.  They have a more conventional
PTEXT	seating config as well (18/79/272).  Originally, they flew European
PTEXT	routes while the -100s flew Hawaii and the Pacific, but the -238Bs
PTEXT	have since been reconfigured and now the -100s and -238Bs fly pretty
PTEXT	much the same routes, except for SFO-LHR (and LAX-LHR, when it gets a
PTEXT	747) which a -100 doesn't have the range to handle.  They aren't fully
PTEXT	interchangeable because the -238Bs have a different seating config,
PTEXT	due to their main galley being on the main deck instead of below as on
PTEXT	the -100s.  (The first three -238Bs are slightly different from the
PTEXT	latter four, too, primarily in the setup of the upper deck galley, but
PTEXT	this doesn't seem to be a significant operational difference.)
#BLANK#	
QUOTED	>- Are the 2 744s picked up from the Northwest cancellations used differently 
QUOTED	>  than the other 22 747-422s?
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The -451s are essentially the same as all but the first six -422s.
PTEXT	The first six have more premium seats than the others (36/123/142
PTEXT	vs 18/80/320).  From what I've heard (and observed), the ORD-NRT
PTEXT	flights always rate one of these six, while the four not working
PTEXT	that route are assigned to various routes based on demand.

PTEXT	Yesterday in our local newspaper, American Eagle announced that they
PTEXT	were ending all service to Nashville from Willard Airport
PTEXT	(CMI)... leaving us with no flights at all toward the southeast (and
PTEXT	leaving my boss, who flew frequently to DCA on business, and got much
PTEXT	better service via Nashville, irritated).
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Though I've seen statements from AA that they were winding down their
PTEXT	Nashville hub, I hadn't seen any announcement stating flat-out that
PTEXT	they were ending all commuter service to there at a certain
PTEXT	date... has anyone seen such an announcement?
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	If memory serves me correctly, CMI's remaining flights (all turboprops
PTEXT	or prop service) go to ORD (I don't think MDW anymore), STL, DTW, MSP
PTEXT	and IND (which may not last long if USAir is dehubbing there).

QUOTED	: heard of overexpansion, the purchase of Frontier, and clever use of
QUOTED	: CRSes by the traditional airlines.  In any event, PE had little choice
QUOTED	: in the matter of its terminal---the North terminal was inadequate.
#BLANK#	
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	My, my, my... Trying to compare a brand new airport and a new terminal is 
PTEXT	quite the apples and oranges analogy to me... PE staff did get to see the 
PTEXT	inside once the building shell was up, but the passengers never did! 
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	While it is true that the increase in lease costs that PE was to 
PTEXT	experience in Term C was more than what they were paying for with the 
PTEXT	North Term, it was also fixing a major image problem for the carrier in 
PTEXT	terms of being a non-modern airline who still had an entirely outdoor 
PTEXT	hub operation in the mid 80's. The hope was that by going to the new 
PTEXT	terminal, the hub would work more effectively from a service standpoint. 
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I can only assume that people are more willing to fly on an airline using
PTEXT	jetways with reasonable gate seating areas versus a carrier who used an 
PTEXT	older facility with inadequate seating areas, poor heating/air 
PTEXT	conditioning, and a bunch of rolling stairways.. Have you ever walked up 
PTEXT	the stairs to a 747 with all of your carryons?. Not a pretty site in 
PTEXT	the rain or in the middle of winter....
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I don't have specifics on the construction cost, but most of the physical 
PTEXT	plant construction was financed by the Port from what I remember: PE was 
PTEXT	only locked into the long term lease and not really liable for more than 
PTEXT	the jetways, bagbelt systems and other interior furnishings for space 
PTEXT	occupied by PE. In general, the Port provides the basics i.e. lighting,  
PTEXT	walls, floor coverings in the public areas and concourse halls, 
PTEXT	heating and air conditioning. The carrier provides the rest i.e. gate 
PTEXT	holdroom carpeting, ticket counters, etc....
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	In this regard, the costs are the same at DIA as they were for PE/CO at 
PTEXT	EWR. The major difference is that for PE, there was no increase in landing 
PTEXT	fees or general cost of doing business increases. They retained the same 
PTEXT	maintenance and catering facilities, as well as the proximity to their 
PTEXT	training facilities and general offices. They were able to maintain the 
PTEXT	same contracts for hotels, fuel, etc... This is not the case at DIA, 
PTEXT	where the investment in a maintenance facility for most carriers was 
PTEXT	written off. The proximity and convenience that UA had for their crew 
PTEXT	training facility and their data center is now lost. Many of the 
PTEXT	negotiated hotel contracts for crews had to be cancelled in favor of 
PTEXT	hotels closer to DIA (which are few at the moment...). Fuel, catering and 
PTEXT	other service contract costs will be higher as the contractors now have to 
PTEXT	recoup -their- increased costs... So that is a much higher cost increase 
PTEXT	than what PE would have seen at EWR...

PTEXT	The recent thread regarding the size and classification of airline hubs in
PTEXT	the US inspired (?) me to evaluate all US hubs and rank them in terms of
PTEXT	capacity.  To obtain my information I counted each departing flight operated
PTEXT	by the major airline (and code-sharing regional) at 43 different airline hub
PTEXT	operations.  By multiplying the number of each aircraft type by the its
PTEXT	seating capacity I arrived at a total number of daily departing seats
PTEXT	(weekday).  I used the May 1995 North American OAG (both pocket and desktop
PTEXT	versions), plus airline timetables to fill in a few international gaps.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The definition of what is and isn't a hub gets blurry around the margins.  I
PTEXT	chose to exclude airports like Boston, La Guardia and LAX because I see them
PTEXT	as much more of a concentration of flights than a real hub.  The so-called
PTEXT	hubs of Delta at JFK and United at Dulles are virtually nothing but some
PTEXT	weak, once-a-day feed for a set of international flights.  TWA at JFK,
PTEXT	however, has multiple flights to several destintions which exist independent
PTEXT	of international connection, so I included TWA/JFK.  Another judgement call.
PTEXT	And despite claims to the contrary, several big Southwest airports are de
PTEXT	facto hubs, so there are included.  If anyone really wants to know why I did
PTEXT	or didn't include a particular airport among my hubs, write me directly.

#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	Again the National Institute for Aviation Research has churned out their
PTEXT	annual ranking of Airline Quality.  And unless they've made some serious
PTEXT	changes in their methods (and from what I've heard so far they have not),
PTEXT	their results are pretty much meaningless.
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	I've complained about this ranking before, but recently I came upon the July
PTEXT	1994 issue of "Consumer Reports Travel Letter" which points out the many
PTEXT	flaws of this much-hyped "ranking" quite well.  I'll draw from their
PTEXT	words as well as my own thoughts for this posting.
#BLANK#	 
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	Three semi-reasonable factors used in the Airline Quality Ratings:
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	*Lost Baggage:  Makes sense to me
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	*Bumping:  They only consider *involuntary* bumping, not total denied
PTEXT	boardings due to overbooking.  One of the biggest total-bumpers (AA) is also
PTEXT	one of the best at coaxing people to volunteer, and thus ranks very well.
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	*On-time performance:  This statistic is so manipulated that it is only
PTEXT	marginally related to what "on-time" is commonly perceived as.
#BLANK#	 
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	The AQR includes complaints per 10,000 passengers in their survey, but
PTEXT	counts this as not one but *eight* separate factors ("flight problems",
PTEXT	"fares", "customer service", "refunds", "advertising", "credit", "refunds"
PTEXT	and "other").  By counting this one factor as eight, it makes up almost half
PTEXT	of the entire set of scoring elements.  Complaints are important, but this
PTEXT	is much overstated.
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	The AQR has three factors which are surrogates for "safety".  But there is
PTEXT	absolutely positively no reasonably valid way to include the factor of
PTEXT	safety among the major airlines.  Despite what the fools at Newsweek (who
PTEXT	have demonstrated a clear knowledge of 8th grade algebra with their
PTEXT	statistical evaluations) there is no significant difference between the
PTEXT	major airlines in terms of safety.  This has no business in a quality survey
PTEXT	of any credibility.
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	The AQR includes three factors that have zippo corelation with "quality":
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	*Financial Stability, and
PTEXT	*Cost per Seat Mile:  I suppose they wanted some way of proving that
PTEXT	financially-troubled airlines are "bad".  But ask youself...has AA's Quality
PTEXT	imporved versus 1992 when they were losing money hand over fist?  Is DL's
PTEXT	quality *improving* as they continue to cut ASM costs?  Duh.
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	*Fleet Size:  This is laughable.  Nothing makes an airline with a bigger
PTEXT	fleet have a higher quality serive.  A stronger arguement could be made that
PTEXT	bigger is *worse*, although I think it is a meaningless factor.
#BLANK#	 
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	Lastly, they ignore what Consumer Reports Travel Letter considers very
PTEXT	important tie-breakers:
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	*Comfort:  No consideration is made regarding seat size, pitch or
PTEXT	configuration that airlines offer.  By the AQR system, there is no scoring
PTEXT	difference between a 737 coach seat and a 747 sleeper seat.  Somehow I think
PTEXT	there is a quality difference they've missed here.
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	*Food:  Food service is typically low among reasons for chosing a specific
PTEXT	airline, ranking below price, schedule and frequent flyer considerations.
PTEXT	Yet when reporting on "quality", the quality and availability of food
PTEXT	service is viewed as important.  In other words, most will fly Airline X if
PTEXT	the schedule, fare or FF miles are right, food or not.  "Quality" does not
PTEXT	lead them to chose one line over another.  Yet replace the meal with peanuts
PTEXT	and customers will scream.
#BLANK#	 
#BLANK#	 
PTEXT	The misguided AQR ranks the majors in this order:
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	AA, WN, UA, DL, US, NW, HP, TW, CO
#BLANK#	
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Comsumer Reports Travel Letter divised a similar rating system based on
PTEXT	seven factors.  Each line was given a score of 0 to 10 (ten is best) in all
PTEXT	seven categories using 1993 data.  Here are their results:

PTEXT	On the subject of CO DEN-LGW.  The route is alive for the time being,
PTEXT	although not for long, as you will notice that it is an aircraft and crew
PTEXT	scheduling nightmare; the aircraft must be ferried in and out of DEN.
PTEXT	This is a route that SHOULD have been enormously successful for CO.
PTEXT	London is Denver's largest international destination, and from a
PTEXT	convenience standpoint, virtually all London traffic should have preferred
PTEXT	CO34 to any other carrier's connect service.  Additionally, CO SHOULD have
PTEXT	been able to sell out their superior BusinessFirst seats on the route
PTEXT	daily.  Any executive bound for London would have been crazy to fly in
PTEXT	conventional J class via ORD or DFW just to support his mileage account.
PTEXT	The biggest problem with the route was CO's failure to market it.  Very
PTEXT	few people in the Denver area even knew about the service.  CO had a sales
PTEXT	staff of 8 for the entire region (I assume that UA had in excess of 50)
PTEXT	and therefore was unable to get the word out to the community's travel
PTEXT	agents.  Typically, the flight was filled with group traffic...very low
PTEXT	yield.  I doubt that the flight will last beyond the summer schedule, and,
PTEXT	I disagree with Robert Gordon; look for United to want it LHR or not.

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	    If fliers think that air travel is becoming more like a trip by bus, I
PTEXT	guess that assessment may be strengthened when new carrier Western Pacific
PTEXT	Airlines launches their flying billboards.
PTEXT	    Western Pacific, which will fly to points in the Southwest U.S. from its
PTEXT	hub in Colorado Springs, is scheduled to begin service Friday (April 28),
PTEXT	according to a report in the April 24 edition of Aviation Week & Space
PTEXT	Technology. And in an attempt to subsidize its "low" fares, the airline has
PTEXT	instituted an "Air Logo" program in which it will sell space for advertise-
PTEXT	ments on the exterior of its Boeing 737-300 jets.
PTEXT	    The first company to sign up for the "Air Logo" program is The Broadmoor
PTEXT	Hotel, a 5-star resort in Colorado Springs. Aviation Week includes a photo of
PTEXT	a Western Pacific jet wearing The Broadmoor's "advertisement." At best, the
PTEXT	plane could be said to resemble a corporate jet; at worst, it brings to mind
PTEXT	the city buses that are "wrapped" in a colorful message for the local zoo,
PTEXT	newspaper or sports team.
PTEXT	    The center of the fuselage is dominated by the words "The Broadmoor/
PTEXT	Colorado Springs" in letters that are almost three times the size of the
PTEXT	letters most airlines use to identify themselves on their planes. The hotel's
PTEXT	slogan, "European Grandeur in the Colorado Rockies," covers the rear of the
PTEXT	fuselage in slightly smaller letters, and the hotel's emblem -- a stylized
PTEXT	"B" surrounded by 5 stars -- fills the tailfin. The stylized "B" has also been
PTEXT	painted on the 737's engines. Squeezed onto the front of the fuselage are the
PTEXT	letters "WP" and the words "Western Pacific."
PTEXT	    Tom DeNardin, Western Pacific's vice president of sales and marketing,
PTEXT	told the magazine, "We have the power to expose a corporation to an enormous
PTEXT	middle-income and high-income audience at a minimal cost-per-thousand."
PTEXT	American Express and the Adolph Coors Co. are also considering buying space
PTEXT	on WP's jets, according to the report.
PTEXT	    I'm surprised that Frank Lorenzo hadn't thought of this when he was
PTEXT	trying to squeeze every cent out of Eastern and Continental. The flying
PTEXT	billboard concept may become popular with beleagured carriers, but I think it
PTEXT	has two major obstacles to overcome before it's adapted by other airlines.
PTEXT	    First, the concept actually would have made more sense when jetways
PTEXT	weren't so common at airport gates. Today, commuter fliers are actually the
PTEXT	only passengers who get a good look at their plane as they board it. At many
PTEXT	airports signs at the gates and jetway corridors, as well as the seating
PTEXT	arrangement in the waiting areas, make it difficult for those inside the
PTEXT	airport to view the planes at the gates.
PTEXT	    Second, even though flying is safer than driving to the local Food Lion,
PTEXT	crashes do occur. USAir has enough of a PR problem when its logo is
PTEXT	prominently displayed amid twisted plane wreckage in photos accompanying
PTEXT	coverage of a major crash, so a company like Coors probably wouldn't want to
PTEXT	renew its "Air Logo" contract if its trademark became associated in the
PTEXT	public's mind with a highly publicized air disaster.

PTEXT	airline it was 10 years ago, and its fleet is almost twice as large as it 
PTEXT	was 10 years ago. They improved the delivery of their product over this

PTEXT	With expansion came new aircraft. Same for UA and DL. As quality drops,

PTEXT	Personally, I'm not too fond of Cathay Pacific's management, and I do

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	4000 seats a week aren't that many.  However, there is no reciprocating
PTEXT	fifth-freedom benefit for CX, hence, CX thinks it's doing Qantas a favor
PTEXT	by letting QF picking up pax in HKG to BKK/SIN (and perhaps to Europe).
PTEXT	Airlines like Malaysia, Thai, and even Singapore have been offer
PTEXT	below-market (actually, should be below-CX) European fares from HKG.
PTEXT	Therefore, I don't think QF's European traffic is the thing that really
PTEXT	pisses CX off.
#BLANK#	
QUOTED	> Cathay's mgmt

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Well, I have to argue with you on this one.  Cathay has been very conscious
PTEXT	about its cost.  It has moved some of its operations from Hong Kong to
PTEXT	reduce costs.  The management was very aggressive in making the cockpit
PTEXT	and cabin crews to accept longer working hours and reduced benefits.  The
PTEXT	aggressiveness resulted in a walkout by the cabin crew during Chinese New
PTEXT	Year of 1993.  However, the management was firm with its position and the
PTEXT	cabin crew gave in.  CX is one the lowest cost operators among major East
PTEXT	Asian airlines even though doing business in Hong Kong is very expensive.

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Well, the L1011 utilization is not a very good example for at least two
PTEXT	reasons:
#BLANK#	
ITEM	1. CX's L1011s are used just like the B737/MD80 are used by US carriers.
ITEM	   Most of the sectors served by CX's L1011s are between 1.5 hours to 3.5
ITEM	   hours.  Furthermore, many East Asian airports have night curfews.
ITEM	   Therefore, 6-9 hours of utilization are not unreasonable.  CX is
ITEM	   definitely not alone in this category.  If you check out TG's, MH's,
ITEM	   CI's A300 and SQ's A310 utilizations, you'll find CX's L1011 number is
ITEM	   not low.  Actually, CX has been very good in keeping high utilization
ITEM	   of its long-haul aircraft.  When CX got its first few B747s in 1979/80,
ITEM	   I was shocked that the average B747 utilization for CX was around 16
ITEM	   hours a day!
#BLANK#	
ITEM	2. CX's L1011s are fully depreciated, thus, they can afford to collect
ITEM	   some dust (remember there are many more L1011s in the deserts that are
ITEM	   not generating a single cent of revenue).  I believe CX also operate a
ITEM	   lot of extra and "chartered" flights.  For example, supplement flights
ITEM	   are quite common on the HKG-TPE run.

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I think you're a little bit harsh on HK.  HK has one of the freest markets
PTEXT	in the world.  Do not extrapolate HK's conservative aviation policies to
PTEXT	general trading policies.  The Hong Kong Aviation Authority may be
PTEXT	anti-competition, but the Australian government has been practicing
PTEXT	protectionism for a long long time.  To cite a few Australian
PTEXT	anti-competition aviation policies that I can remember:
#BLANK#	
ITEM	1. In early 80s, it tried to limit Southeast Asian carriers' six-freedom
ITEM	   rights from Australia to Europe (Kangaroo route).  (This is the only
ITEM	   incidence that I can remember a government made a _major_ effort to
ITEM	   impose limit on six-freedom rights.)
ITEM	2. in 1993, NW's OSA-SYD fiasco,
ITEM	3. and the recent unilateral suspension of a free market agreement
ITEM	   with New Zealand.

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I addressed this in my original post, but let me summarize here.  I
PTEXT	agree that new aircraft have greater fuel efficiency and reduced
PTEXT	reliability/ maintenance costs.  At the same time, a new 100-120 seat
PTEXT	airplane (read: 737, MD-80, or 320 series) costed around $30,000,000
PTEXT	(last time I checked - around 1991) and the cost of hush-kitting an
PTEXT	older airplane like a 727 or DC-9 costs around $3,000,000 (again,
PTEXT	these figures were approximate in 1991).  Thus, the increased fuel
PTEXT	efficiency and reduced reliability/maintenance costs are *dwarfed* by
PTEXT	the ~$25,000,000 savings of using hush kits over new aircraft.  When I
PTEXT	worked at Northwest, there was a study floating around that made the
PTEXT	calculations and showed the savings to keep the old aircraft flying.
PTEXT	I wish I had a copy of this.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	As the original poster noted, this savings is especially true for the
PTEXT	DC-9s which tend to age better than the B-727 or B-737.  This explains
PTEXT	why Northwest and Valujet are holding onto a fleet of old DC-9s.  (As
PTEXT	someone noted to me in a private email, Valujet's fleet is
PTEXT	*exclusively* a DC-9 fleet).

PTEXT	HNL seems to have been under construction now for well over 10 years.

PTEXT	Basically, we started with a palm-lined, single-tower airport to a

PTEXT	renovation.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The worst joke of all was the whole inter-island terminal fiasco.
PTEXT	Aloha & Hawaiian used to have a separate area--and when a third
PTEXT	carrier (oooh, was it Mid-Pac? They so come and go) wanted to share
PTEXT	the space, it got the big cold shoulder. So it managed to get counter
PTEXT	space at the main terminal--and all of a sudden a lot of people
PTEXT	decided that was a good idea (no need to wait for the Wikiwiki
PTEXT	Shuttle). That irked Aloha & Haw'n to no end...and after a lot of
PTEXT	wrangling and shuffling, Haw'n built its own one-story terminal near
PTEXT	Nimitz Highway. Aloha didn't like that--so they prompted an entire
PTEXT	renovation of its old terminal. Now, we have a huge, ugly parking
PTEXT	edifice (for inter-island all-day parkers, I guess) for Aloha--and
PTEXT	Haw'n operates out of it too (don't ask what happened to its old "new"
PTEXT	terminal--I think it got hand-me-downed to the smaller

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	To make a long story short (and to bring this to the original thread),

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Our local newspaper had an article today on an in-flight shutdown of
PTEXT	a B767 engine:
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	ATC lost radio contact with a UA jetliner over the North Altlantic as
PTEXT	the Boeing 767, having lost one of its two engines, headed on an
PTEXT	emergency course for Bermuda and flew too low to communicate with the
PTEXT	controller's antiquated radios. Contact with the airliner was lost for
PTEXT	stretches of 8-10 minutes or longer. Controllers say that if the plane
PTEXT	had been forced to ditch in the water, they would not have had a precise
PTEXT	location to send rescuers.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	A private subcontractor, Aeronautical Radio Inc., was used to relay radio
PTEXT	messages between the airliner and the ATC. The company transcribes
PTEXT	reports and then transmits them by teletype to the Controllers at he
PTEXT	FAA's New York Center. The controllers keep track of locations in their
PTEXT	heads, or use grease pencils on Plexiglas!!!!
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The incident itself was as follows: the pilot was flying at 33000 ft
PTEXT	about 330 miles south of Bermuda when he radioed that he had a possible
PTEXT	oil filter blockage in one engine and asked for permission to descend to
PTEXT	25000 ft. The controller on duty received the information on teletype,
PTEXT	telephoned Aeronautical Radio, and asked to be patched through to the
PTEXT	plane. -- that took 5 minutes and was considered to be pretty quick!
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The pilot later reported that the engine had shut down. The pilot had to
PTEXT	descend to unusually low altitudes because of a loss in cabin pressure.
PTEXT	The shut-down of one engine meant the loss of an air conditioning unit,
PTEXT	and the remaining unit overheated.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Newsweek had an article just last week on the antiquated ATC equipment!
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Fortunately, the plane was in constant contact with United's own
PTEXT	dispatchers in Chicago, via satellite link.

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I'm not too fond of Cathay's management nor the British colonial

PTEXT	and few Chinese) even though it is supposedly the airline of Hong Kong
PTEXT	in where 98% of the population are Chinese.  (They didn't even put their

PTEXT	I try to avoid flying CX as much as possible.  Nevertheless, both the HK
PTEXT	Colonial Government and Cathay have made significant contributions to the
PTEXT	prosperity of HK (and made of a lot money for themselves, too).
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	BTW, the Chinese name of Cathay is literally translated as "a prosperous
PTEXT	and peaceful nation."  Let's hope the prosperity will last even after
PTEXT	1997.

PTEXT	(From the 4/30/95 Dallas Morning News)
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	So what's all this mean?  I don't know, because there are so many

PTEXT	      -Relative fares/expected service (Southwest: did anyone expect them

PTEXT	      -Int'l vs. domestic food service (People expect more Int'l, I think)
PTEXT	      -Whether costs are being cut by increasing efficiency or reducing food
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	On that last note,  The book _Frequent Flyer_ (by Bob Reiss), describes 
PTEXT	some of the results when Delta asked their employees for cost cutting 
PTEXT	suggestions:
PTEXT	   "A flight attendant had suggested eliminating a decorative piece

PTEXT	exceeded $1.4 million a year.  A food service employee modified a machine 
PTEXT	to cut cakes into fourteen instead of thirteen pieces.  A flight 
PTEXT	attendant designed a new way to package napkins.  By perforating the 
PTEXT	packs they came in, they could be removed one at a time, and the unused 
PTEXT	napkins saved instead of thrown out after each flight...."
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	(side note:  What did those more knowledgeable than I think about that

PTEXT	IMHO, the future of the A340 is better than the A330.  There will
PTEXT	always be airlines which will be uncomfortable operating long-range
PTEXT	twins.  For example, Thai International, with 8 B777-200As and 6
PTEXT	B777-300s on order, will not consider the B777-200B to replace the
PTEXT	MD-11s.

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Interestingly that you brought up the subject.  I've previously discussed
PTEXT	this subject with Mr. Jennings through e-mail, too.  A few days ago, I
PTEXT	posted an "analysis" of the A330 program to sci.aeronautics.airliners
PTEXT	and cross-posted to m.t.a.  Well, we'll have to wait for Karl to approve
PTEXT	it. :-(.

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	SIA is looking for a regional jet, hence, the MD-11 is definitely out of
PTEXT	the question.  Furthermore, SIA does not have a good track record with MD,
PTEXT	or, perhaps I should say MD does not have a good track record with SIA.
PTEXT	SIA dumped the DC-10 after ~ 5 years of operation.  SIA did not even take
PTEXT	the delivery of the last two (of seven) aircraft and sold them directly to
PTEXT	Varig.  Around 1990, SIA signed an MOU with MD to order up to 20 MD-11s.
PTEXT	At the time, one of the major reasons for the order was because both Delta
PTEXT	and Swissair (SIA's cross-equity partners) had ordered the MD-11s.  Later,
PTEXT	MD and P&W failed to guarantee certain performance, and SIA switched to
PTEXT	the A340.  Currently, SIA has 17 A340s on order (plus 20 options) for
PTEXT	long-haul services.  Thus, on paper, the A330 is the more likely
PTEXT	candidate, and Airbus made a news release a few weeks ago claiming that
PTEXT	they were ahead of Boeing in the SIA competition.  Last year, Boeing was
PTEXT	ready to lease eight B777s to SIA, and SIA's chairman was reported to say
PTEXT	that the deal was too sweet to refuse.  I believe the lease offer is still
PTEXT	on.
#BLANK#

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	As I said it before, the edge apparently goes to Airbus, but I believe
PTEXT	Boeing has a good chance.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I don't know whether the Japanese contents in the B777 will affect SIA's
PTEXT	decision, but I believe Singapore Aerospace is a subcontractor of the B777
PTEXT	program, too.  IMHO, the B777 is better sized for the Asian market.  If I
PTEXT	were an SIA executive, I would have picked the B777.  The B777-200 may be
PTEXT	a little too big to replace some of SIA's A310s (so is the A330, and SIA
PTEXT	is reported to be looking for a smaller aircraft later on).  However, the
PTEXT	B777-300 is the most ideal aircraft to replace the B747s used for regional
PTEXT	services.  SIA's order is important to the A330 program, but I would not
PTEXT	go so far to say it's a make-or-break order for the A330.  The A330
PTEXT	program still has some other potential customers.  (See my up-coming
PTEXT	"analysis", if you are interested.)

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	747s are not good choices for short/mid-length domestic flights and are
PTEXT	essentially unused for such in the U.S.  In fact, most of the city pairs
PTEXT	you'e named above are dominated by flights on 757s, 737s, 767s, and
PTEXT	DC10s.  SFO-ORD and SFO-JFK have only a few flights on 747s, and these
PTEXT	are positioning flights for continuing international flights.  
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The 747 is a horrible choice for the intra-Japan flights, and the only
PTEXT	reason they use them there is because Narita cannot be expanded to
PTEXT	accomodate the number of flights that would be needed to properly handle
PTEXT	these flights with 737s or similar aircraft.

PTEXT	Not for several years.  UA is still performing "D" maintenance checks
